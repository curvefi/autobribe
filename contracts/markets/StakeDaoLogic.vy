@notice This contract lets trusted third parties post
    Curve-sponored bribes on StakeDAO's Votemarket through
    the IncentivesManager contract.
@dev The contract relies on snekmate for access control.
@dev The contract uses the expressions: bribes,
    voting incentives and bounties interchangably to refer
    to the action of granting rewards when a veCRV holder
    votes for a designated gauge.
